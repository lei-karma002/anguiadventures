                    </div>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Polangui is a first class municipality in the province of Albay, Philippines. It is now a thriving, progressive first-class growth center, considered as the most promising and potential economic destination of the flourishing trade and commercial activities of the Third District of Albay. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        The origin of the name Polangui has many versions. The foremost and most accepted version is “that of a giant, robust tree that existed majestically in the early municipal settlement”. The natives of the settlement called it “Oyangue”, which also served as the early landmark of the area where new settlers looked upon it in their wandering. Similarly, the early Spanish frontier settlers found this tree, and it became their famous settlement landmark. The settlement was then called “Binanuaan” but was often referred to as “Oyangue” by nearby settlers. As more settlers came to dwell and engage in various trade endeavors with the indigenous dwellers, the more the settlement was known in distant areas by the name “Oyangue” referring to the tree landmark that was more widely accepted than “Binanuaan”. The passing of generations corrupted the word “Oyangue” into several acronyms. Most acceptable and widely used before were “Polangue” and later "Polangui,” which have remained today.

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Another legend is about the story of a maiden named "Pulang Angui," which means "Red Maria" (Angui is the nickname for Maria), who loved red colors for dress and whose beautiful body, face, and red lips became the object of affection by the males to the point of adoration. She was modest in her ways, talented for possessing various skills, and had a happy disposition, showing a love of the arts and religion. She would lead the tribe in the festivities. When the Spaniards came, the soldiers who first set foot in Polangui asked for the name of the place. The native thought the foreigners were asking for the name "Pulang Angui" and said so. The Spaniards recorded the name of the place as Pulangui, a concoction of the name that was later, as the years went by, converted to Polangui. Geography.
